# Gh0stenstein
2.5D first person shoot based off code from pygame.com
Requirements: Won't run on Python 3.  Instead, install Python 2.7 and the matching 32-bit pygame download.
4/3/15 - Added a monster (Pinky from Doom) that follows the user around.  No fighting takes place.  Pinkie just follows arround like a lost puppy.   
Enjoy
